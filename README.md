# fpga-processor-airhockey

In this project, I built a processor using the Verilog HDL, which was then deployed on an FPGA. This included elements such as the ALU, regfile, multiply/divide module, and adding bypassing and stalling in order to efficiently and effectively implement a custom instruction set. Then, along with a 
partner I built a physical miniature air hockey table to be controlled by the processor using a combination of behavioral Verilog and assembly code.
The processor controls sensors for goal scoring, a VGA display for reporting the score and timing of the air hockey game, and turns on lights and sounds 
when a goal is scored. The technical details of the processor, wiring diagrams, and images of the final result are contained in the PDF report.
